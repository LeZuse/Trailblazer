A location tracking service for Android, using [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com)
==================================================================================

Use this library in your android application to track the device's location.

The service will report the location and the timestamp that the location was updated to firebase.

You can start and stop the service with an intent, and the parameters are controlled via extras packaged with that intent.

Using [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com), you can get a realtime feed of location updates as they are broadcast.

For an example app using this service, and a simple google maps page displaying the information, see [here](http://example.com)
